# Helpful [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Wilfred/helpful/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Wilfred/helpful?branch=master) [![MELPA](http://melpa.org/packages/helpful-badge.svg)](http://melpa.org/#/helpful)

Helpful is an alternative to the built-in Emacs help that provides
much more contextual information.

![screenshot](screenshots/helpful.png)

## Usage

Install from MELPA, then call one of the following commands:

* `helpful-callable`
* `helpful-function`
* `helpful-macro`
* `helpful-command`
* `helpful-key`
* `helpful-variable`
* `helpful-at-point`

If you want to replace the default Emacs help keybindings, you can do
so:

``` emacs-lisp
;; Note that the built-in `describe-function' includes both functions
;; and macros. `helpful-function' is functions only, so we provide
;; `helpful-callable' as a drop-in replacement.
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h f") #'helpful-callable)

(global-set-key (kbd "C-h v") #'helpful-variable)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h k") #'helpful-key)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h x") #'helpful-command)
```

I also recommend the following keybindings to get the most out of
helpful:

``` emacs-lisp
;; Lookup the current symbol at point. C-c C-d is a common keybinding
;; for this in lisp modes.
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-d") #'helpful-at-point)

;; Look up *F*unctions (excludes macros).
;;
;; By default, C-h F is bound to `Info-goto-emacs-command-node'. Helpful
;; already links to the manual, if a function is referenced there.
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h F") #'helpful-function)
```

[Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) users can use Helpful with
counsel commands:

``` emacs-lisp
(setq counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable)
(setq counsel-describe-variable-function #'helpful-variable)
```

## Features

### Source code

![screenshot](screenshots/helpful_source.png)

Helpful will try really hard to show the source code. It shows the
source code for interactively defined functions (unlike the built-in
Help) and falls back to the raw sexp if no source is available.

### View Callers

![screenshot](screenshots/helpful_refs.png)

Helpful will show you where a function is being called!

### Prettier Docstrings

![screenshot](screenshots/helpful_docstring.png)

Docstrings in helpful:

* Highlight the summary (the first sentence)
* Include cross-references to other functions/variables
* Linkify references to Info nodes
* Hide superfluous punctuation

If a symbol is also documented in the Info manual, helpful will
provide a link to the relevant section too.

### Symbol Properties

![screenshot](screenshots/helpful_props.png)

Helpful will show you the properties that have been applied to the
current symbol. This provides visibility of features
like edebug or byte-code optimisation.

Helpful will also highlight any symbol aliases.

### Describe Commands

Helpful provides a separate `helpful-command` function, for when you
just want to view interactive functions.

### View Keymaps

![screenshot](screenshots/helpful_bindings.png)

Helpful displays any keybindings that apply to interactive functions.

### Integrated Tooling

![screenshot](screenshots/helpful_tools.png)

You can trace, debug or disassemble functions from inside
Helpful. This is discoverable and doesn't require memorisation of
commands.

### Aliases

![screenshot](screenshots/helpful_aliases.png)

If a function has multiple aliases in Emacs, Helpful will show all of
the aliases defined.
